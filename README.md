# SpaceX-Applied-Data-Science-Capstone
The commercial space age has arrived, with companies making space travel more accessible than ever. Among them, SpaceX stands out, promoting Falcon 9 rocket launches at a significantly lower cost than competitors, thanks to its innovative approach to reusing the first stage.</br>
In this capstone, we embark on a journey to predict the success of Falcon 9 first stage landings using advanced Machine Learning models. We aim to provide valuable insights for cost estimation in the fiercely competitive space launch industry by:</br>
-Utilizing advanced Machine Learning models to predict the success of Falcon 9 first stage landings.</br>
-Identifying and analyzing key factors that influence the success of Falcon 9 first stage landings.</br>
-Providing valuable insights into the space launch industry by understanding the relationship between various factors and landing success.</br>
